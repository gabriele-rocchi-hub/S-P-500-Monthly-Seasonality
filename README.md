This project aims to analyze the monthly seasonality of the S&P 500 index, one of the main benchmarks of global equity markets. 
Seasonality analysis helps identify how average returns vary depending on the month, highlighting potential historical patterns. 
The project downloads historical index data, calculates monthly returns, and visualizes them through charts and descriptive statistics, providing a useful tool to understand possible cyclical market behaviors.
